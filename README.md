# currencyFormatter 


In initial Stages - this auto formatter will work for US Style Currency formatting only. 

Motivation : 

The reason for righting such a library is that other formatters are HUGE in size as compared to the percantage of functionality it caters.

Typical Example being , a Banking Website where your search transactions on a statement page by inputing an Amount , and it should be currency formatted like ( 999,999) . Just for one onput on the screen - other libraries hold more than 20 KBs of minified JS which might proove a bottle neck for faster page load. 

For more wider options and Generic Auto Formatter : User AutoNumeric.

Goal is to make a JS which is less than 10KB UNMINIFIED.
